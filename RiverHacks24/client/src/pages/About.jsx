      <p class = "p_about"> Introducing "Girl PowerEd," where the future of STEM education is fun, 
        inclusive, and powered by women! Our platform is designed to inspire and educate young girls 
        in the exciting world of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). 
        How, you may ask?
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Our approach is simple yet effective: Girl PowerEd is a website where dedicated female mentors, 
        actively engaged in STEM studies or professions, deliver live and recorded customized workshops 
        focused on essential STEM skills like coding. Embracing a nostalgic twist, projects are designed 
        to infuse fun into learning; for example, mastering Python by coding beloved childhood games 
        like Webkinz. From coding to electronics to 3-D modeling with CAD, our curriculum covers a wide 
        range of topics, ensuring that girls can explore their interests and discover their passions 
        with confidence. These mentors offer live teaching sessions and conduct Q&A sessions to maintain 
        the freshness and engagement of recorded materials, ensuring an enriching experience for young 
        women exploring STEM.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        At Girl PowerEd, we believe that every girl has the potential to excel in STEM, regardless 
        of background or experience. That's why Girl PowerEd places a heavy emphases on accessibility,
        diversity, equity, and inclusivity. Our website has been specifically curated to ensure that 
        individuals with color blindness or other visual impairments can clearly see and read materials.

        better serve them!
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Our motto, "Who codes? Girls code," embodies our commitment to empowering girls to embrace 
        their potential as creators, problem-solvers, and leaders in the world of STEM. By providing 
        access to quality education and mentorship in a supportive and inclusive environment, we're 
        paving the way for a brighter, more diverse future in STEM. 
        <br></br>

        Join us at Girl PowerEd and unleash your inner scientist, engineer, and tech whiz! 
        Together, let's rewrite the narrative of STEM education and inspire a new generation of girls 
        to dream big, break barriers, and change the world—one line of code at a time.</p>

      <h1 class = "title_h1">Why the World Needs Girl PowerEd</h1>
      <p class = "p_about">Studies have shown that women and men show no significant difference in their 
        STEM-related abilities; despite this, women are still underrepresented in high-paying STEM jobs.
        Studies have shown this gap for years. It's surprising, considering how companies led by women 
        often perform better than those lacking their leadership.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        This shows a big challenge: even 
        though women have the skills and potential for success in STEM, there are still barriers 
        stopping them from fully participating and advancing in these fields.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Girl PowerEd aims to tackle these barriers, here and now, by empowering young women who are our
        future leaders of tomorrow.</p>

        <br></br>
        What have studies discovered about women's success, and society's success, from girls being in STEM?
        Let's take a look at some notable statistics about young women in STEM:
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <ul>
          <li><u>ECONOMIC GROWTH:</u> Encouraging more women to pursue STEM careers can significantly 
            contribute to economic growth and innovation. According to a report by the National 
            Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT), increasing female participation in 
            the STEM workforce could lead to a <mark>12% growth</mark> in GDP.</li>
            <br></br>
            <li><u>DIVERSITY DRIVES INNOVATION:</u> Diversity in the STEM workforce leads to more innovative 
              solutions and better outcomes. Research from McKinsey & Company found that companies with 
              gender-diverse executive teams were <mark>21% more likely</mark> to outperform their 
              competitors in terms of profitability.</li>
            <br></br>
            <li><u>ADDRESING GENDER DISPARITIES:</u> Despite progress, gender disparities persist in 
            STEM fields. Women are underrepresented in STEM occupations, comprising only <mark>28% of 
            the workforce</mark> according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Increasing female participation 
            can help address these disparities and create more equitable opportunities for all.</li>
            <br></br>
            <li><u>HERE'S WHY Girl PowerEd's AUDIENCE IS YOUNG WOMEN:</u> According to the "Generation STEM" 
            report by the Girl Scout Research Institute, <mark>74%</mark> of high school girls across the 
            country are interested in the fields and subjects of STEM. Perceived gender barriers are still 
            high for girls and may help explain why STEM fields aren’t their top career choices.</li>
