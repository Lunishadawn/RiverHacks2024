        At Girl PowerEd, we believe that every girl has the potential to excel in STEM, regardless 
        of background or experience. That's why we've gathered a team of passionate college students, 
        graduate scholars, and professionals—all women with expertise in various STEM fields—to guide 
        and mentor the next generation of female innovators. Our approach is simple yet effective: 
        we leverage the power of familiar childhood games, books, and media to teach complex STEM 
        concepts in a way that's engaging and relatable. From coding to electronics to 3-D modeling 
        with CAD, our curriculum covers a wide range of topics, ensuring that girls can explore their 
        interests and discover their passions with confidence.
